# EduScript System Reconstruction - Comprehensive Fix

## 🎯 MISSION OVERVIEW

Fix the EduScript exercise system architecture, consolidate components, rebuild the parser system globally, and establish Categorize exercise as a working proof-of-concept with all its variations.

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

### ✅ What's Working (DO NOT BREAK)
- **Core Exercise Types** in `packages/edu-exercises/src/components/`:
  - Multiple Choice (all variations except Cards logic flaw)
  - Matching (original & new variations)
  - Ordering (original variation)
  - Fill Blank (core functionality)
- **Styling System**: `@components` SCSS architecture is solid and working
- **Type System**: TypeScript integration is comprehensive
- **Basic Parser**: Works for established types with original variations

### 🔴 Critical Issues to Fix
1. **Fragmented Architecture**: Components scattered between `packages/edu-exercises` and `apps folder`
2. **Parser System**: Needs global reconstruction for reliability and extensibility
3. **Broken Exercise Types**: Categorize, Selector completely non-functional
4. **Broken Variations**: Threesome matching, aligner ordering, single ordering styling
5. **Styling Inconsistency**: Apps folder components have broken styling

## 🏗️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION (IMMEDIATE)

#### 1.1 Component Migration Strategy
**Goal**: All exercise components in `packages/edu-exercises` as single source of truth

**File Structure Target**:
```
packages/edu-exercises/src/
├── components/
│   ├── display/                    # All exercise displays
│   │   ├── FillBlankDisplay.tsx
│   │   ├── MatchingDisplay.tsx
│   │   ├── MultipleChoiceDisplay.tsx
│   │   ├── OrderingDisplay.tsx
│   │   ├── CategorizeDisplay.tsx    # Move from apps + rebuild
│   │   ├── SelectorDisplay.tsx      # Move from apps + rebuild
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── create/                     # All builders/editors
│   │   ├── EduScriptEditor.tsx
│   │   ├── ExerciseCreator.tsx
│   │   ├── ExercisePreview.tsx
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── styles/                     # Local component styles only
│       └── *.css                   # Only for component-specific styles
├── exercises/                      # Exercise type configurations
│   ├── fillBlank.tsx
│   ├── matching.tsx
│   ├── multipleChoice.tsx
│   ├── ordering.tsx
│   ├── categorize.tsx              # Rebuild completely
│   ├── selector.tsx                # Rebuild completely
│   └── index.ts
```

**Actions Required**:
1. **Audit apps folder**: Identify all exercise-related components
2. **Migration checklist**:
   - Move display components to `packages/edu-exercises/src/components/display/`
   - Move builder components to `packages/edu-exercises/src/components/create/`
   - Remove any local styling - ensure ONLY `@components` SCSS is used
   - Update all imports across the codebase
   - Update exercise registry references

#### 1.2 Registry System Consolidation
**Update exercise registry to point to consolidated components**:
- Remove duplicate references
- Ensure consistent component resolution
- Validate all exercise types have proper display/builder components

### PHASE 2: GLOBAL PARSER SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION (CRITICAL)

#### 2.1 Parser Architecture Goals
**Current Problem**: Parser is fragile, inconsistent variation handling, missing grammar for new types
**Solution**: Build rock-solid, extensible parser architecture

#### 2.2 Core Parser Improvements Needed

**A. Grammar System Standardization**
```typescript
interface ExerciseGrammar {
  type: ExerciseType;
  variations: {
    [variationName: string]: {
      detectPattern: (lines: string[]) => boolean;
      parseContent: (lines: string[]) => ExerciseContent;
      validateSyntax: (lines: string[]) => ValidationResult;
      exampleSyntax: string;
    }
  };
  defaultVariation: string;
}
```

**B. Unified Parsing Pipeline**
1. **Block Detection**: Extract `{...}` blocks reliably
2. **Metadata Parsing**: Extract `@metadata()` with validation
3. **Config Parsing**: Extract `@config()` with variation detection
4. **Type Detection**: Determine exercise type from metadata
5. **Variation Selection**: Choose parser based on variation or default
6. **Content Parsing**: Parse content using type+variation specific grammar
7. **Validation**: Validate syntax and content structure
8. **Conversion**: Convert to exercise payload format

**C. Error Handling & Recovery**
- **Graceful Degradation**: If one exercise fails, continue parsing others
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Show exactly what went wrong and where
- **Syntax Suggestions**: Suggest corrections for common mistakes
- **Partial Parsing**: Extract what's valid even if some parts fail

#### 2.3 Specific Parser Fixes Required

**A. Categorize Exercise (PRIORITY - PROOF OF CONCEPT)**
- **Original Variation**: `CATEGORY = item1 | item2 | @fill('library', count)`
- **Ordering Variation**: Pre-categorized items that need fixing
- **Lake Variation**: Mixed approach with items and functions

**B. Selector Exercise**
- **Grammar**: `Text with [selectable words] and [multi word phrases]. @ins(instruction)`
- **Support**: Both single words `[word]` and phrases `[multiple words]`

**C. Fix Broken Variations**
- **Matching Threesome**: Make proper 3-column variation (not separate logic)
- **Ordering Aligner**: Implement `@align(criteria)` grammar
- **Ordering Single**: Fix styling while keeping logic

**D. Global Parser Robustness**
- **Function Parsing**: Improve `@fill()`, `@var()` support for future use
- **Decorator Handling**: Better `@hint()`, `@ins()`, `@img()` parsing
- **Metadata Validation**: Ensure required fields are present
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration throughout parsing

### PHASE 3: CATEGORIZE EXERCISE RECONSTRUCTION (PROOF OF CONCEPT)

#### 3.1 Complete Categorize Implementation
**Goal**: Make Categorize exercise type fully functional with all 3 variations as proof the system works

**Variations to Implement**:

**A. Original Variation**
```
@config(variation = original)
ASIA = China | Japan | @fill('asian_countries', 3)
EUROPE = UK | France | Germany
```
- **Display**: Draggable items into category boxes
- **Validation**: Items must be in correct categories

**B. Ordering Variation**  
```
@config(variation = ordering)
// Pre-categorized items with some in wrong categories
FRUITS = apple | chair | banana    // chair is wrong
FURNITURE = table | orange | desk  // orange is wrong
```
- **Display**: Columns with items, user fixes incorrect categorizations
- **Validation**: All items in correct categories

**C. Lake Variation**
```
@config(variation = lake)
= apple | banana | chair | table
// User creates their own categories and assigns items
```
- **Display**: Free-form categorization, user creates category names
- **Validation**: Reasonable categorization (flexible validation)

#### 3.2 Styling Requirements
- **Consistent Design**: Match the quality of working exercises (Multiple Choice, Matching original)
- **SCSS Integration**: Use only `@components` SCSS, no local styles
- **Responsive**: Work on all screen sizes
- **Animations**: Smooth drag/drop interactions
- **Theme Support**: Work with existing theme system

### PHASE 4: TESTING & VALIDATION

#### 4.1 Component Migration Testing
- **Verify**: All working exercises still work after migration
- **Check**: No broken imports or missing styles
- **Validate**: Registry properly resolves all components

#### 4.2 Parser Testing
- **Grammar Testing**: Test all grammar patterns with valid/invalid inputs
- **Error Testing**: Ensure errors are caught gracefully
- **Performance**: Parser handles complex exercises efficiently
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing exercises continue working

#### 4.3 Categorize Exercise Testing
- **All Variations**: Test original, ordering, lake variations work
- **Error Cases**: Test malformed syntax handling
- **Edge Cases**: Empty categories, duplicate items, etc.
- **Integration**: Test with EduScript editor and preview
