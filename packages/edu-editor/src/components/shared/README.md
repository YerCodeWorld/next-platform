# THEME SWITCHER:

Removed adaptation as I don't think I'm going to need it. Kept it here just in case.

# POST TOC:

Nice to have there. It's a cool component for pc readers. 

# POST SHARING:

Sharing logic must be added

# POST HEADER:

Must be replaced with an actual component that read dynamic data (user, avatar, read time, ...), and the image
they actually want to place there. Works good as a mock or example tho. 

# HEADER:

Will remove completely and replace with something else.

# POST CONTENT:

Placeholder we induce the html into and load it up. 

# POST READING PROGRESS:

Also pretty cool to have in order to see some sort of progress bar
