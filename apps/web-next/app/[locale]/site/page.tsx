// TODO:
/**
 * You will create a general page that will contain varying information.
 * Using tab navigation, you will add:
 *
 * About: Use about components (@repo/components at ./packages/components/src/components/site/...)
 * Testimonies: Create this from scratch, but you may use the BreadCrumb (EduComments)
 * Contact: Use the contact component  ./packages/components/src/components/site/SiteContact.tsx
 * FQA: Use the FQA component
 * etc: Ideas you might add
 *
 * Make sure that, even though we are using tab navigation, we can access a
 * specific section through a URL, so we can set buttons to navigate here.
 *
 * If you consider there is a better way of implementing this page, do so and ignore tab navigation
 * instructions. But you must use the components (after adapting them of course), to simplify things.
 * The components are hardcoded and many can be reduced to some dynamic function for child creation.
