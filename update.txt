### 2. Dynamics Editing Implementation
Based on the DynamicEditExample, I've implemented:

#### New Files Created:
- `/app/[locale]/activities/[slug]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit existing dynamics
- `/app/[locale]/activities/new/page.tsx` - Create new dynamics
- `/styles/activities/dynamicsEditor.css` - Styling for dynamics editor

#### Key Features:

  - Title, Objective, Description, Content
  - Materials Needed, Duration, Student limits
  - Age Group, Difficulty, Dynamic Type
  - Publishing options (draft/published, featured for admins)
- Permission checks - only teachers/admins can create/edit
- Authors can edit their own dynamics, admins can edit all
- Rich text editor (TiptapEditor) for content creation
- Proper navigation with locale support
- Form validation and error handling

#### Grid Updates:
- Updated DynamicsGrid component to show edit buttons for authorized users
- Fixed create dynamic button URLs (changed from `/create` to `/new`)
- Added pencil icon to edit buttons

### 3. Technical Improvements
- All navigation routes now properly include locale
- Consistent permission checking across blog and dynamics
- Proper error handling with toast notifications
- Form state management with controlled components
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 4. User Experience
- Teachers and admins see create buttons in landing pages

The implementation follows the same patterns as the blog editing feature, ensuring consistency across the platform.
